SDG Accountability in India

I found this exhaustive study(2023) on progress of SDG(Sustainable Development Goals) 2030 - India by Harvard Professor S. V. Subramanian. 
Being mindful of the incomplete assessments in India which are sometimes potentially misleading, his team have developed a precision-weighted multilevel modelling strategy to derive estimates for 33 SDG indicators associated with 9 Goals based on National Health Family Survey(2019-21) data. 

In his next study(2024), he calls for action that there's a fundamental disconnection between District & Parliamentary Constituency(PC) units. 
Due to the absence of PC identifiers in nationally representative surveys and lack of hierarchical structure where PCs perfectly nest within districts, two methodologies were developed by his team to enable PC-level estimations from the NFHS data(district-level).

I picked up these two studies & further research to present "One Nation -Two Maps" where I compare these SDG indicators in selected districts (707) against their parliamentary constituencies (543) to highlight how the lack of alignment in data boundaries leads to inconsistent accountability on MPs(Members of Parliament). 
In addition, the deductions identify focal points within each constituency to drive policy decisions to accomplish SDGs. 

I've tried my best to avoid all the complex information as much as possible, also making sure important bits aren't omitted for a layman to understand. 

I'm open to critique. Thank you.

P.S. This is a personal, independent research initiative based on publicly available academic data. The findings are exploratory and meant to spark discussion, not serve as final policy recommendations.
